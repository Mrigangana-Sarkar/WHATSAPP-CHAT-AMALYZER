Sentiment Analysis: Gauge the general mood or sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of conversations.

User Activity: Identify the most active contributors in the chat.

Topic Modeling: Organize messages into main themes or topics.

Peak Hours Analysis: Determine the busiest times in group activity.


Technologies Used

This project uses Python along with libraries for data analysis, NLP, and machine learning. Core tools include Pandas for data manipulation, NLP libraries (such as NLTK or spaCy) for text processing, Scikit-Learn for machine learning tasks, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.
